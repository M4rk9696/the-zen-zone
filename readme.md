## The Zen Zone

[The Zen Zone](https://thezen.zone) is an exploration into a kind of digital meditation, by providing small "games" that capture your attention.

### The Games

**Switches**: This is perhaps the most simple one of the set, you are given 100 switches to turn on.

**Swirl**: In this activity, you trace the pattern of a spiral, deminishing its size slowly.

**Break**: This involves moving your mouse to break a larger circle into smaller pieces.
